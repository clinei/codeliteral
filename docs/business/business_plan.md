# Business plan

First, get a job, so you can work on the prototype and figure out the design and build out the features. That will let you get preliminary feedback, as well. Then, start creating a C# or Java version, as an IDE plugin. Share those plugins with your colleagues to get feedback and reknown. When Jai gets released, start studying the compiler and build a Jai version. Make a few videos using the Jai version, showing the benefit and component list (elevator pitch), the components in detail, and practical use cases. Stream using the debugger and build up suspense. Make a website with a PayPal link and upload the videos and link them on the website and vice versa. Measure the initial response and feedback. When feasible, quit day job and work full-time, and look for remote workers from the Handmade Network. Use Estonian colleagues to increase interest in Jai and the debugger. Learn how to demo to customers. Make a C# or Java version, and try to sell it to Estonian companies and individuals. Use three sessions, first being introduction, second being customer use case, and third the Jai language. Sell the Jai version cheaper than the C# version. Say that the C# version has a higher price because it's harder to maintain. Hire and train Estonian colleagues, and build out company culture of consultants, salesmen, developers, and streamers. Make some games. Make a Java version. Slowly grow company and community.
