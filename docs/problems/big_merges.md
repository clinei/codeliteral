# Big merges

Imagine this situation. The CEO comes up with an idea for a feature. A programmer is assigned to develop that feature. The developer completes the feature. Two other developers now have to review the code for bugs, and the feature developer has to fix any merge conflicts. This can take a long time, because there is a lot of new code, and their full effects can be hard to understand.

This would be easier if the company had previously created visualizations and program analysis tools that made it easier to understand the interactions inside the system, and automatically catch bugs that would escape the naked eye.
