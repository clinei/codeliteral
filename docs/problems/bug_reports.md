# Bug reports

When a program breaks, you can just run it again, start recording, do the broken thing again, stop recording, and send it to the developers, possibly through the program itself. This is the easiest way to create useful bug reports. No need for steps to reproduce, environment configuration, or an overly detailed explanation of what you intended to do, and what actually happened.

The developers can then leverage the [full history](../interesting_introductions/benefits_of_full_history.md) of what happened, and replicate the [exact environment](../interesting_introductions/save_the_environment.md) in which it happened. This would make bug reports more useful, and lead to faster fixes, and more satisfied customers.
