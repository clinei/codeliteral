# Syntax tree

This part of the documentation refers to the main view of the tool, which looks like code, but you move around between individual code elements like variables and expressions, instead of letters and words. You can also change how the code looks, by replacing variable names with their values, and collapsing complex expressions to only see their results. You can also jump between variable changes and uses, to rapidly explore chains of causes and effects.

If you haven't done it already, please check out the [prototype](https://clinei.github.io/codeliteral/), because that part is actually implemented. The rest of this article will be completely dry and theoretical, which is useful when you really want to understand what something is, but it's best to learn by doing, and the prototype has a nice interactive tutorial that shows most of the use cases for these features.

### Bookmarks
The user can move to a code element and set it as a bookmark. They can then repeat that process for other code elements that they want to revisit while solving their problem. They can then move backwards and forwards in that array of bookmarks.
