# Benefits of Full History

All historians and most smart people know that studying the past and noticing the patterns is very useful for understanding where we are now, where we are going, and how to get there by making use of those patterns. We can use the same thing for software systems.

If we record an entire program, we can quickly scroll through and notice interesting events. We can also mark certain points as interesting, and jump between them without having to run the program again and skipping breakpoints that aren't as interesting. We can also use data science and create custom visualizations that make it easier to notice higher-level patterns.
