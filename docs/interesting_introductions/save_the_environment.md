# Save the Environment

When you record the code as it executes on the client's machine, you're not just recording what it does, but also the environment in which that happens. You can simulate that environment as you try to fix the bug. Instead of hiding behind words like "it works on my machine", you can directly understand which differences in the environment caused the bug.
