# Agile

Right now, when a new developer joins a team, they read the source code and build up their knowledge of how the program works. Some of them even use the program, and try to translate the lines of code into their tangible results. But very few actually run the program in a debugger and trace through every codepath, to understand more deeply what actually happens and how.

That's probably because the debuggers we use today are not that useful for understanding a lot of code fast and in great detail. They're mostly meant for people who already understand the code being debugged. This is evidenced from the design of breakpoints and forward-only debugging.
