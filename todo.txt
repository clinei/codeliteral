Bugs:


we can delete times_executing, everything will be executed only once, because loops are unrolled and every call is cloned

Ideas:

the run function could use the same code path as the step functions, to reduce potential drift

we can use a colored text-shadow instead of a background-color

we could scroll the cursor into view

we could unroll loops into ifs to show every cycle

returns being assigns too seems to cause a lot of problems, maybe we should just mark the assign as actually a return

indent is one element in a two element flex row, content is the other element

we should allow the user to set certain data flows to a specific color, so they can trace it more easily
how do we extend the flow? by pressing U
at which points can we extend the flow? every use of a value that changes flow or another value
how do we move between the change points? step into the identifier in the flow and step next or back
how do we set automatic breakpoints?

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
