Bugs:

we should have a comment on the general design

should not clone when printing

for loop not implemented, put declarations before cycles, put cycle end as last statement, otherwise like while

Ideas:

values_shown could show the value of an ident when it gets changed on the left hand side

we could set the execution to scroll automatically by some speed, and maybe bounce between flowpoints

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
