Bugs:

most instructions are in pairs, make a table so they are aligned vertically

we should have a comment on the general design

check how stepping next and into looks like

should not clone when printing

for loop not implemented, put declarations before cycles, put cycle end as last statement, otherwise like while

continue and break not implemented

else if not implemented

true and false keywords not implemented

increment and decrement not implemented

Ideas:

need to implement heap and stack memory, and map_memory_to_changes and map_memory_to_uses
malloc and free

pressing M makes the prev/next use/change look in memory instead of ident
needs visual feedback

we could inline if statements, but declarations in them have to be transformed

pressing a button when the cursor is on an ident shows the value of that ident at that point in time
especially when it's the left hand side of an assign or opassign

we could set the execution to scroll automatically by some speed, and maybe bounce between flowpoints

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
