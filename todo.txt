Bugs:

returning is broken for the recursive factorial

when stepping next on an expression, we need to set that it has already been run, so things don't get run twice, because side effects

Ideas:

indent is one element in a two element flex row, content is the other element

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
