Bugs:

Refactor:

transforming should be done on step_into, need this for recursion, 
what about order getting messed up when we expand one thing, go back, and opening up something else?


Ideas:

indent is one element in a two element flex row, content is the other element

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
