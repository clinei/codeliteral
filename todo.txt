Bugs:

flowpoints are broken, first and last flowpoints jump between themselves

Ideas:

press D to delete flowpoint

values_shown only when selection cursor has not been printed yet

execution_stack should push extra on expressions that returned

should we have breakpoints for non-executed code?

would unordered flowpoints be useful?

the run function could use the same code path as the step functions, to reduce potential drift and bugs
running is sort of different though, further research is needed

indent is one element in a two element flex row, content is the other element

we could find the bug, fix it live, recompile, and run directly from the buggy place to check if it was fixed
